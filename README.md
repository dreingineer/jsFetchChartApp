# jsFetchChartApp

JavaScript fetch (csv) and graph the data using chart.js. For practice coding and learning purpose only.

Feel free to check my code. I am working on this mini app to test and explore charts.js. I also want to thank and give credit to the author of the tutorial.

I added basic node.js functionality to serve multiple static files - July 29, 2020.
