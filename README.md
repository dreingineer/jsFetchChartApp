# jsFetchChartApp

JavaScript fetch (csv) and graph the data using chart.js and leaflet.js. For practice coding and learning purpose only. I am also adding my own implementation based on my own knowlege and experience from my job developing and collaborating with other devs in corporate setting.

Feel free to check my code. I am working on this mini app to test and explore charts.js and leaflet.js(new lib learned). I also want to thank and give credits to the author of the tutorial The Coding Train (^ ^).

I added basic node.js functionality to serve multiple static files - July 29, 2020.

Use NeDB as database for this mini app, initial functionalities are get and post - August 1, 2020.

Added "develop" branch for development environment - August 1, 2020.

Updated commits and branches are merged to develop. Implemented calls to external API are via NodeJS node_fetch. NodeJS routes are consumed in the client side using fetch function. Methods implemented (client side) are GET and POST, posted data are saved using nedb. - August 4, 2020.
